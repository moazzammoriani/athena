                <h2>Who are we?</h2>
                <p>
                We are a group of individuals who are brought together by our passion to learn about the world. In order to improve our experience of learning and to make the most of our limited time here we want to learn as efficiently as possible. One of the best ways to learn is to learn from others through engagement ans this is why we formed Athena. So that other people who are also interested in learning anything about the world can help each other out and share whatever there expertise is in.

                We wish to bring together an online community to promote self-learning. We wish to enrich the lives of everyone who seeks to know more about the world by allowing them to develop the cognitive toolkit necessary to reach such a goal more easily.

                        <p>
                        Not at all! You only have to pay if you wish to become a pro user. You can gain most of the benefits of the community just by being a basic user.

                        <p>
                        The purpose of the pro membership is to give people access to the online library. The pro membership gives members access to scholarly journals and and ebook databases. So we believe those options have value worth paying for.
